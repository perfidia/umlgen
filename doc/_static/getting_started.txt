Getting started
===============

In order to get started with the umlgen just play around to get used to it (and follow the instructions).

Context diagram
---------------

To use the context diagram tool you need to have PIL with TTF support installed

The context diagram tool can be found in the folder src/ under the name of umlgen-context. When you type `umlgen-context --help` you will see
the following options:

- `-c FILE`, to specify a config file to use
- `-o OUTPUT` to specify an output file to use
- `-x WIDTH` to specify the width of the output image
- `-y HEIGHT` to specify the height of the output image
- `-m MULTIPLIER` to specify how big we want the UML object on the image to be (0.5 means half the original size, 2.0 means two times as big)

so, to see an example usage, type:

`umlgen-context -c ../context/example2.xml -o output.png`
